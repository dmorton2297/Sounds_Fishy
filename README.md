# Sounds_Fishy
This project was created for Mobile Makers Academy's Helping Hack Chicago hackathon. The hackathon was sponsored by the 
non-profit organization Second Sense, who council people with vision loss, and help incorporate technology into their lives 
to help them live a normal life. 

This app is targeted to be a game that someone can play with partial to complete visual impairment. The objective of the game 
is to move your finger around the screen of your iPhone, and catch a "fish" by trapping it into a corner. To be able to locate
the fish, their is a tone playing, that increases in frequency as you are closer to the fish. Also, a vibration occurs when 
you collide with the fish.

##Functionality
* Able to use a tone to locate the fish on the screen.
* Haptic feedback for when you collide with the fish
* Completely Accessible, with spoken instructions and cues.
